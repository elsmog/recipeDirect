      <p>Making the world a better place can be achieved in large and extremely meaningful ways- regularly attending protests, doing volunteer work, or making lifestyle shifts. However, for some, these big steps are not attainable on a daily basis. There are many things that make activism inaccessible for a person, and its not up to anyone to decide for another how to spend their time. Sometimes, people simply need more time in their day for themselves and their families, and that in itself improves the quality of their life greatly.</p><br>
      <p>Which brings me to my own proposal- and its not one you'd think of right away, that's for certain. Meal planning. <b>Better meal planning for a better world.</b> What does that have to do with saving the world you say? Well, I've been a stay-at-home mom and homemaker for 4 years. Most days I cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner and prepare snacks in between. That's on top of housework, taking care of my son, spending time with my husband, schoolwork, and personal time for myself. and I don't get a lot of <i>that</i>, I'll tell you!</p><br>
      <p>I love to cook, but I don't have hours to leisurely hang about the kitchen. Oftentimes, when I search for a recipe, I have to scroll endlessly, wading through the author's life story, interspersed with ads of course, to get to the recipe. Once at the actual recipe, say I decide I don't like it or don't have the ingredients. I have to scroll, scroll, scroll through another page. Sure, I understand how bloggers make their money, but it is extremely frustrating!</p><br>
      <p>My website will be a collection of healthy, delicious recipes which will be simple to follow, with common, inexpensive ingredients, that home cooks will be able to prepare quickly for their families. Most importantly, I will present the recipes without long narratives and abundant ads. My audience will be home cooks like me, without an excess of time and money. They will appreciate being able to get right to the "meat and potatoes" of a recipe without their time being wasted.</p><br>
      <p>I will design a Recipe Selector which will help my users decide upon a recipe to choose. It will randomly select a recipe based on the user's selection of a main ingredient. For instance, in the Main dish section, if a user selects "Chicken," it will generate one of the chicken recipes for their perusal. If they don't like that recipe, they will click "next" and another recipe will be provided. There will also be  Vegetables, Sides, and Desserts sections that can be similarly perused.</p><br>
      <p>I will create the website from my own tried and tested recipes. I already have many, and am always adding more. As for my design, I will use Murach's book as well as the other references below to learn how to build my functions and make my website look good. I will take my own photographs so I can accurately represent the recipes on the page.</p><br>
      <p>I aim to present the website with 7-10 recipes in each section (Main, Vegetable, Side, and Dessert) before it goes live. I will continue to add at least one recipe per section each week. I will add new sections such as Beverages or Bread within the first month of going live. I will aim to have my Recipe Selector complete before going live as well.</p>
